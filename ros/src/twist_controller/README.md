Carla is equipped with a drive-by-wire (dbw) system, meaning the throttle, brake, and steering have electronic control. This package contains the files that are responsible for control of the vehicle: the node `dbw_node.py` and the file `twist_controller.py`, along with a pid and lowpass filter that you can use in your implementation. The `dbw_node` subscribes to the `/current_velocity` topic along with the `/twist_cmd` topic to receive target linear and angular velocities. Additionally, this node will subscribe to `/vehicle/dbw_enabled`, which indicates if the car is under dbw or driver control. This node will publish throttle, brake, and steering commands to the `/vehicle/throttle_cmd`, `/vehicle/brake_cmd`, and `/vehicle/steering_cmd` topics.
