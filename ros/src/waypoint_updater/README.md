This package contains the waypoint updater node: `waypoint_updater.py`. The purpose of this node is to update the target velocity property of each waypoint based on traffic light and obstacle detection data. This node will subscribe to the `/base_waypoints`, `/current_pose`, `/obstacle_waypoint`, and `/traffic_waypoint` topics, and publish a list of waypoints ahead of the car with target velocities to the `/final_waypoints` topic.
