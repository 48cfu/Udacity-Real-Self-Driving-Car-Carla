This package contains the traffic light detection node: `tl_detector.py`. This node takes in data from the `/image_color`, `/current_pose`, and `/base_waypoints` topics and publishes the locations to stop for red traffic lights to the `/traffic_waypoint` topic.

The `/current_pose` topic provides the vehicle's current position, and `/base_waypoints` provides a complete list of waypoints the car will be following.

You will build both a traffic light detection node and a traffic light classification node. Traffic light detection should take place within `tl_detector.py`, whereas traffic light classification should take place within `../tl_detector/light_classification_model/tl_classfier.py`.
